## 🎯 Our Mission

MemoTape was created from a simple idea: **What if memories could be preserved as vivid, story-like experiences?**

With MemoTape, users can generate a `.memo` file by uploading photos from a specific moment—complete with the date, location, and a short background story. Each `.memo` file captures the essence of that memory, and when viewed through the MemoTape Reader, those moments come alive again in a flowing, narrative experience.

**Your memories, told like a story.**
